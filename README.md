# StoreIt
This project is a storage solution for storing images, documents, medias, etc, as well as share them with other users built as a learning exercise by following a YouTube tutorial by Javascript Mastery(JSM). It helped me gain hands-on experience with Appwrite, NextJS 15, NextJS server actions, dynamic pages and components,etc. 

## Overview
This application simulates basic Google Drive functionality, where users can:
- Upload different types of files
- Organize files by folders
- Share files with other users securely
- View and manage uploaded media
By building this project, I gained hands-on experience with **Appwrite** for backend services, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and modern UI styling.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization along with OTP verification
- File upload and storage using Appwrite
- Folder structure and file organization
- File sharing with other registered users
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 15 with TypeScript
